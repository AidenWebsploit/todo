## A couple ways to deploy an app on [Amazon Lightsail](https://aws.amazon.com/lightsail/)

The application is a super simple Node / Express application that connects back to a Mongo database. 

Deploy the application with:

* [Lightsail's MEAN stack blueprint](#lightsail's-mean-stack-blueprint)
* [Docker containers with Docker Compose](#docker-containers-with-docker-compose)
* Docker containers with Single-node Docker Swarm (TBD)
* Docker containers with a Single-node Kubernetes Cluster (TBD)
